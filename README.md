# Simon Game

An implementation of the classic Simon memory game using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` directly in your browser to play. No build step or server is required.

## Development

- Source files are in `js/` and styles in `css/`.
- Audio assets are located under `assets/sounds/`.
- You can use any editor; project was created in WebStorm.

## Git ignore

This repository includes a `.gitignore` tailored for JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm/IntelliJ) and common JavaScript artifacts:

- Ignores IDE project files such as `.idea/` and `*.iml`.
- Ignores typical Node/JS folders and logs like `node_modules/`, `*.log`, and lockfiles.
- Ignores OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`).

If you use a different editor or add build tooling later, extend `.gitignore` accordingly (e.g., add `dist/`, `build/`).
